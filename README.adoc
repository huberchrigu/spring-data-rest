= About this forked repository

This repository fixes the bug https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST-1096[DATAREST-1096]. It seems like the main repository
is not maintained anymore.

= Spring Data REST

The goal of the project is to provide a flexible and configurable mechanism for writing simple services that can be exposed over HTTP.

The first exporter implemented is a JPA Repository exporter. This takes your JPA repositories and front-ends them with HTTP, allowing you full CRUD capability over your entities, to include managing associations.

=== Installation

Installation instructions are in the docs:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/[https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/]

=== License

The Spring Data REST is https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 licensed].

== Contributing to Spring Data Rest

Here are some ways for you to get involved in the community:

* Get involved with the Spring community on Stackoverflow. Please help out on the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-rest[spring-data-rest] tag by responding to questions and joining the debate.
* Create https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST[JIRA] tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from https://help.github.com/forking/[forks of this repository]. If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
* Watch for upcoming articles on Spring by https://spring.io/blog/[subscribing] to spring.io.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement]. Signing the contributorâ€™s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. If you forget to do so, you'll be reminded when you submit a pull request. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Note

We disabled the github issues since we want to use https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST[JIRA] as the only issue tracker.
All open existing issues have been automatically imported into JIRA, so nothing was lost :)

= Running CI tasks locally

Since this pipeline is purely Docker-based, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your `test.sh` script before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what the CI server does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-rest-github adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-rest-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-rest-github`
+
Next, run your tests from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw clean dependency:list test -Dsort` (or whatever profile you need to test out)

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

If you test building the artifact, do this:

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-rest-github adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-rest-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-rest-github`
+
Next, try to package everything up from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw -Pci,snapshot -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package`

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
